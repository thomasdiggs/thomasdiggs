## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a computer scientist.

I am currently working on various coding and math problems from Codewars.com, AdventofCode.com, and ProjectEuler.com.

I am currently learning the C programming language and web API development with ASP.NET Core 8.

Check out my <a href="https://affirmationapi-g5abftgteggkhqgj.westus2-01.azurewebsites.net/api/affirmation">web API in ASP.NET Core</a> for an affirmation whenever you need it.
